In early-stage planning, their potential is often evaluated at the demand side, using large-scale building energy models. However, from the financial and energy efficiency standpoints, the actual potential is also depending on the development of the physical pipework connecting the supply heating station with the consumer substations. To this end, this work proposes a framework for the automated generation of a plausible network layout by solving a minimum spanning tree problem connecting the different stations and assigning a sizing peak power to each network element. Although fully adapted to data available in other contexts, we show here an application using Swiss open geodata, which allows for a quick analysis for any location in Switzerland with a few user inputs. The application in Broc (CH) shows a good match with the operating DHN in terms of piping linear length.","tags":["District Heating Network","Python module"],"title":"DHgeN: Automated Generation of District Heating Network Layouts for Feasibility Studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1663599726,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663599726,"objectID":"5ddc8c63b8991e65ea8e4220daf6e219","permalink":"/project/dhgen/","publishdate":"2022-09-19T17:02:06+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/dhgen/","section":"project","summary":"A Python module for generating district network layouts","tags":["RD","tools","GIS"],"title":"DHgeN","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1647702126,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647702126,"objectID":"20249d3153d72db3ee69950c0194404e","permalink":"/project/heatlearn/","publishdate":"2022-03-19T17:02:06+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/heatlearn/","section":"project","summary":"AI-estimated Building Heat Demand","tags":["RD","tools","GIS","web"],"title":"HeatLearn","type":"project"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Peronato","Roberto Boghetti","Jérôme H.

It can be used by planners and decision-makers to identify clusters of high energy demand in a given urban area and efficiently plan, for example, district heating networks. Various data sources exist at the pan-European level describing land use and built areas. Combined with statistical data, such maps have been used in previous research for estimating building energy performance aggregated at the hectare level, using engineering assumptions. In this paper, we show that large-scale land-use maps alone can be used for predicting annual building energy demand with an accuracy comparable to the one of previous engineering models. We hence present a preliminary method based on Convolutional Neural Networks at different spatial resolutions. The resulting model was trained and tested in an area of about 170 km2 in Geneva (Switzerland) using a local annual heating demand dataset comprising 16239 buildings. On a 300-m aggregation tile, the obtained mean error (14.3%) is significantly reduced compared to the one of a simple linear model (37.2%). Using solely land-use data, we also achieve similar results for a 100-m tile as those of an engineering model from the literature.","tags":["District Heating Network","Land Use Maps","Deep learning"],"title":"A machine-learning model for the prediction of aggregated building energy demand from pan-European open datasets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["August Wierling","Valeria Jana Schwanitz","Sebnem Altinci","Maria Bałazínska","Michael J.

Benefitting from an increasing quality of 3D models of cities, a comprehensive methodology to estimate potential energy generation from visually-acceptable PV, energy use from buildings, and economically viable micro-grid operation is proposed, by combining validated dynamic energy simulation tools into an open-source computational platform. The platform intends to be useful for urban planners and officials in charge of planning a large-scale BIPV installation into an existing neighborhood: simulations are carried out at the city scale, inclusive of façade potential, shading from vegetation and detailed roof shapes with super-structures. Social acceptability is investigated through a novel visual impact assessment methodology and grid integration solutions are analyzed with reference to their associated costs. Under a conservative scenario, a median of 10 kW hAC-electricity / m2 heated floor area per year is available from BIPV production in Geneva (Switzerland), covering 32% electricity demand for space heating from heat pumps, or, alternatively, almost 10 times the one for space cooling. Visual impact has demonstrated not to be concurrent to grid integration constraints at the current stage, but rather to contribute to filtering building envelope surface and avoid grid curtailment of excess electricity. In the near future, with an increased grid efficiency, visual impact is expected to become a crucial criterion to limit the integration extent.","tags":["solar energy in cities","BIPV","Energy planning","energy-hub","visual impact","load match"],"title":"Designing and assessing solar energy neighborhoods from visual impact","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["outreach"],"content":"","date":1615215726,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615215726,"objectID":"a9ef5c9e622dcaae655f56d71dfd8277","permalink":"/project/uhi-heidinews/","publishdate":"2021-03-08T17:02:06+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/uhi-heidinews/","section":"project","summary":"I had the chance to share some ideas and actions to tackle the urban heat island effect on the Swiss French-speaking online magazine Heidi.news.","tags":["outreach","press"],"title":"Any solutions to Urban Heat Island?","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":["outreach"],"content":"","date":1615215726,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615215726,"objectID":"606d626dbcc1bcfa3577212ece3dbaf9","permalink":"/project/uhi-elioth/","publishdate":"2021-03-08T17:02:06+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/uhi-elioth/","section":"project","summary":"I co-authored a post on Urban Heat Island published on Elioth's blog.

The growing interest in urban building energy models among researchers, urban designers and authorities has led to the development of a diversity of models and tools, evolving from physical to more advanced hybrid models. By critically analyzing the published research, this paper incorporates an updated overview of the field of urban building energy modeling and investigates possibilities, challenges and shortcomings, as well as an outlook for future improvements. The survey of previous studies identifies technical bottlenecks and legal barriers in access to data, systematic and inherent uncertainties as well as insufficient resources as the main obstacles. Furthermore, this study suggests that the main route to further improvements in urban building energy modeling is its integration with other urban models, such as climate and outdoor comfort models, energy system models and, in particular, mobility models.","tags":["energy simulation","urban energy planning","urban building energy modeling","","bottom-up energy modeling","building archetype","thermal zoning"],"title":"Urban Building Energy Modeling: State of the Art and Future Prospects","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"   #slide-window { position: relative; width: 700px; height: 394px; overflow: hidden; top: 0px; left: 0px; } #slides-list { width: 700px; height: 394px; position: absolute; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; -webkit-transform: translate3d(0px, 0px, 0px); transform: translate3d(0px, 0px, 0px); transition: all 0.66s ease; -webkit-transition: all 0.66s ease; } .slide { list-style: none; position: relative; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 700px; height: 394px; background: #ccc; text-align: center; line-height: 100%; background-size: cover; background-position: 50% 50%; color: #fff; -webkit-transform: translate3d(0px, 0px, 0px); -webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d; } .nav { position: relative; z-index: 9; top: 45%; cursor: pointer; color: #fff; opacity: 0.7; transition: all 0.66s ease; -webkit-transition: all 0.66s ease; } .nav:hover { opacity: 1.0; } #left { left: 3%; float: left; } #right { right: 3%; float: right; }             sliderJQuery = jQuery.noConflict(); sliderJQuery(function( $ ) { $.global = new Object(); $.global.total = 0; $(document).ready(function () { var slideWindowWidth = $('#slide-window').width(); var slideCount = $('#slides-list li').length; var totalSlidesWidth = slideCount * slideWindowWidth; $.global.item = 0; $.global.total = slideCount; $('.slide').css('width', slideWindowWidth + 'px'); $('#slides-list').css('width', totalSlidesWidth + 'px'); $('#left').click(function () { resetAutoSlide(); performSlide('back'); }); $('#right').click(function () { resetAutoSlide(); performSlide('forward'); }); }); function performSlide(direction) { if (direction == 'back') { var nextSlideId = $.global.item - 1; } if (direction == 'forward') { var nextSlideId = $.global.item + 1; } if (nextSlideId == -1) { moveCss($.global.total - 1); } else if (nextSlideId == $.global.total) { moveCss(0); } else { moveCss(nextSlideId); } } function moveCss(nextSlideId) { var slideWindowWidth = $('#slide-window').width(); var margin = slideWindowWidth * nextSlideId; $('#slides-list').css('transform', 'translate3d(-' + margin + 'px,0px,0px)'); $.global.item = nextSlideId; } var autoSlide = parseInt(\"3000\", 10); var autoSlideInterval; function resetAutoSlide(){ if(autoSlide) { if(autoSlideInterval) { clearInterval(autoSlideInterval); } autoSlideInterval = setInterval(function(){ performSlide('forward'); }, autoSlide) } } resetAutoSlide(); });   In my PhD thesis, I developed a solar 3D mapping tool called SolUR.

Buildings are in fact among the highest worldwide consumers of primary energy, mostly of fossil fuel origin, while still making insufficient use of in-situ renewable energy sources. To find a solution to this situation, many municipalities have promoted the use of solar cadastres mapping the solar energy potential of the existing building stock. However, their implementation has limits from different points of view including assessment accuracy, representation methods, and decision-support. To overcome these limits, this thesis proposes a planning-support system based on the photovoltaic (PV) potential of buildings. The goal is to provide decision-makers and stakeholders with a robust method to assess the potential of photovoltaic electricity generation of existing buildings under uncertain environmental conditions. The developed methodology is based on an urban-scale modeling workflow that includes the simulation of the photovoltaic electricity production and a simplified estimation of the building energy retrofit potential. Existing state-of-the-art models for solar radiation, building energy and PV performance are coupled in the workflow, which relies on a vector 3D city model featuring an accurate representation of buildings, terrain, and vegetation. The proposed modeling workflow also includes an innovative approach for simulating the arrangement of PV modules on the building envelope, which influences both the energy yield and the acceptability of the system. The modeling workflow is in turn integrated into a planning-support system that provides a robust assessment of the photovoltaic potential through risk-averse scenarios. We consider here two crucial yet underestimated uncertainty factors: weather and vegetation. The results are aggregated at different scales and, for each scale, the spatial locations are ranked through pairwise comparisons according to relevant energy indicators. The results are finally displayed in a 3D-mapping tool featuring false-color overlays at the considered aggregation scales to address different objectives and inform decision-makers. We conducted sensitivity analyses towards different input data resolutions and modeling scenarios so as to achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and computational cost and define confidence intervals for the calculated values. The simulated PV yield was also compared against measured data from an existing PV installation.

However, solar potential analyses are usually conducted on 2.5D models, which are limited to roof surfaces. Methods based on 3D models, instead, allow the simulation of solar radiation on all building surfaces also accounting for inter-reflections. 3D models are thus discretized by grids of sensor points on which the solar potential is calculated.  This paper investigates the discretization error in the assessment of solar potential based on 3D models. To this end, we tested the sensitivity of simulated solar irradiation to the resolution of the sensor grid. We analyzed the impact of the grid resolution using typical discretization approaches affecting the spatial arrangement of the sensor points.  The study was conducted in a dense area of the city of Geneva represented at level of detail (LOD) 2. The simulated solar irradiation on 109 buildings was analyzed at different spatial, i.e. per surface and per building, and temporal granularities, i.e. hourly and yearly.  The results show that the error increases linearly for grids spaced at up to 4 m with maximum relative root mean square error lower than 7%. The impact of the grid resolution was found greater for structured grids than unstructured grids. The results also highlight that finer grid resolutions (i.e. smaller spacing) are necessary if the analysis is conducted at high spatial or temporal granularity, notably when analyzing roof surfaces with shading artifacts.","tags":null,"title":"3D model discretization in assessing urban solar potential: the effect of grid spacing on predicted solar irradiation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Peronato","Parag Rastogi","Emmanuel Rey","Marilyne Andersen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"c168f5717a7dda17766c53a121c8d8e1","permalink":"/publication/peronato-toolkit-2018/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T20:32:54.763187Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peronato-toolkit-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Many municipalities and public authorities have supported the creation of solar cadastres to map the solar energy-generation potential of existing buildings. Despite advancements in modelling solar potential, most of these tools provide simple evaluations based on benchmarks, neglecting the effect of uncertain environmental conditions and that of the spatial aggregation of multiple buildings. We argue that including such information in the evaluation process can lead to more robust planning decisions and a fairer allocation of public subsidies. To this end, this paper presents a novel method to incorporate uncertainty in the evaluation of the solar electricity generation potential of existing buildings using a multi-scale approach. It also presents a technique to visualise the results through their integration in a 3D-mapping environment and the use of false-colour overlays at different scales. Using multiple simulation scenarios, the method is able to provide information about confidence intervals of summary statistics of production due to variation in two typical uncertain factors: vegetation and weather. The uncertainty in production introduced by these factors is taken into account through pairwise comparisons of nominal values of indicators, calculating a comprehensive ranking of the energy potential of different spatial locations and a corresponding solar score. The analysis is run at different scales, using space- and time-aggregated results, to provide results relevant to decision-makers.","tags":["3D city model","Spatial decision-support systems","Urban solar potential"],"title":"A toolkit for multi-scale mapping of the solar energy-generation potential of buildings in urban environments under uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"As a board member of the Lausanne Student Chamber Orchestra from 2015 to 2018 (and President in 2017-2018), I curated the communication and social media for some events.

Their application to the urban scale is hence difficult. As an alternative to the existing approaches, we developed an interface to CitySim, a validated building simulation tool adapted to urban scale assessments, bundled as a plug-in for Grasshopper, a popular parametric design platform. On the one hand, CitySim allows faster simulations and requires fewer parameters than traditional BPS tools, as it is based on algorithms providing a good trade-off between the simulations requirements and their accuracy at the urban scale; on the other hand, Grasshopper allows the easy manipulation of building masses and energy simulation parameters through semi-automated parametric workflows. In this paper, we present a preliminary version of the developed plug-in and a typical design workflow for the simulation and visualization of building performance at the neighbourhood scale.

Pourtant, le potentiel solaire n’a pas une définition univoque. Comme nous l’avons déjà vu dans les précédents ouvrages de cette série, il est possible d’opérer une première distinction entre potentiel solaire actif et passif. Le premier se décline en potentiel solaire actif pour systèmes thermiques (production d’eau chaude) et pour systèmes photovoltaïques (production d’électricité). Dans le deuxième, on peut distinguer le potentiel solaire passif pour le chauffage de l’espace intérieur à travers les gains solaires, et l’éclairage à travers la lumière naturelle. Dans la présente étude, nous allons examiner l’irradiation annuelle sur les surfaces des bâtiments, que l’on peut considérer comme un premier indicateur du potentiel solaire actif, sans compter les pertes dues à la transformation en chaleur ou en électricité. Une évaluation du potentiel solaire dès les premières phases du projet, c’est-à-dire lorsque l’on aborde la question de la forme urbaine, permet une intégration plus efficace des critères de performance énergétique. En effet, très souvent, ces questions ne sont abordées que dans les phases avancées du projet, lorsqu’il est plus difficile d’effectuer des changements significatifs sur le projet. Cette étude s’inscrit donc dans une démarche d’évaluation précoce du potentiel solaire de différentes formes urbaines. Les visions urbaines développées par les étudiants de l’atelier du Prof. Emmanuel Rey pour le site de Crissier et présentées dans cet ouvrage se prêtent particulièrement bien à cet exercice d’analyse comparative, car elles présentent des formes urbaines très différenciées.

Due to the complex shape and seasonal variability of vegetation geometry, this topic has gained much attention from researchers. However, existing methods are limited to rooftops as they are based on 2.5D geometry and use simplified radiation algorithms based on view-sheds. This work contributes to overcoming some of these limitations, providing support for 3D geometry to include facades. Thanks to the use of ray-tracing-based simulations and detailed characterization of the 3D surfaces, we can also account for inter-reflections, which might have a significant impact on façade irradiation. In order to construct confidence intervals on our results, we modeled vegetation from LiDAR point clouds as 3D convex hulls, which provide the biggest volume and hence the most conservative obstruction scenario. The limits of the confidence intervals were characterized with some extreme scenarios (e.g. opaque trees and absence of trees). Results show that uncertainty can vary significantly depending on the characteristics of the urban area and the granularity of the analysis (sensor, building and group of buildings). We argue that this method can give us a better understanding of the uncertainties due to vegetation in the assessment of solar irradiation in urban environments, and therefore, the potential for the installation of solar energy systems.","tags":null,"title":"3D-modeling of vegetation from LiDAR point clouds and assessment of its impact on façade solar irradiation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Peronato","Stéphane Bonjour","Jérémie Stoeckli","Emmanuel Rey","Marilyne Andersen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1467331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467331200,"objectID":"a3151fb0c0ed924136edcd9c13bd9453","permalink":"/publication/peronato-sensitivity-2016/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T20:32:54.75496Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peronato-sensitivity-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The assessment of the solar potential in urban areas relies on a geometrical model that can be defined at different levels of detail (LOD).

Since these are typically fixed at the early-design phase, performance assessment methods based on solar considerations at the urban scale are essential to support early decision-making. As the adaptation of the well-developed building performance simulation methods to the urban scale lead to complexity issues, it is of interest to verify whether simpler metrics can act as performance indicators, as is often done at the building level with quantities such as form factor.  This paper first presents a review of existing methods that aim at evaluating aspects such as passive heating and photovoltaic potential. We classify each evaluation metric based on its level of complexity, before choosing a representative subset to be further examined. The goal is to test whether simple metrics fulfill their role as performance indicators when applied to neighborhoods. To do so, the selected metrics, including geometrical parameters (e.g. compactness) and solar exposure levels (e.g. annual irradiation), are compared with simulation results (e.g. heating need), taken as reference values. This is done for two sets of designs: six distinct typologies and a large number of variants from a base case typology.  Results, which show various levels of correlation between simple metrics and the reference values, highlight the limitations of using any one metric and indicate a need to revise the definition and evaluation metrics of various performance criteria for neighborhood designs.","tags":["Correlation","Early-design phase","Neighborhood scale","Passive/active solar potential","Performance metrics","Simulation"],"title":"Review and critical analysis of early-design phase evaluation metrics for the solar potential of neighborhood designs","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Here is a selection of the advertising materials I created for the campaigns of the local section of the Italian Democratic Party (and its youth organization) and diffused as billboards and leaflets between 2009 and 2012.         \n","date":1429455816,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1429455816,"objectID":"42e13b878c1fe20f5973b35abec0849b","permalink":"/project/pd/","publishdate":"2015-04-19T17:03:36+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/pd/","section":"project","summary":"Political campaign advertising","tags":["design","graphics","copywriting"],"title":"Campaigns","type":"project"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Peronato","Emilie Nault","Francesca Cappelletti","Fabio Peron","Marilyne Andersen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"babc081ad1e3d514a0ef5bc218041032","permalink":"/publication/peronato-parametric-2015/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T20:32:54.750793Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peronato-parametric-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper focuses on parametric design-based visualization methods to represent building performance at the neighborhood scale in the perspective of an integrated design-support system.

The analysis highlighted the poor daylight access in high-density urban areas, as well as the limited contribution of roof-stacking to the densification processes.\n       #slide-window { position: relative; width: 700px; height: 300px; overflow: hidden; top: 0px; left: 0px; } #slides-list { width: 700px; height: 300px; position: absolute; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; -webkit-transform: translate3d(0px, 0px, 0px); transform: translate3d(0px, 0px, 0px); transition: all 0.66s ease; -webkit-transition: all 0.66s ease; } .slide { list-style: none; position: relative; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 700px; height: 300px; background: #ccc; text-align: center; line-height: 100%; background-size: cover; background-position: 50% 50%; color: #fff; -webkit-transform: translate3d(0px, 0px, 0px); -webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d; } .nav { position: relative; z-index: 9; top: 45%; cursor: pointer; color: #fff; opacity: 0.7; transition: all 0.66s ease; -webkit-transition: all 0.66s ease; } .nav:hover { opacity: 1.0; } #left { left: 3%; float: left; } #right { right: 3%; float: right; }              sliderJQuery = jQuery.noConflict(); sliderJQuery(function( $ ) { $.global = new Object(); $.global.total = 0; $(document).ready(function () { var slideWindowWidth = $('#slide-window').width(); var slideCount = $('#slides-list li').length; var totalSlidesWidth = slideCount * slideWindowWidth; $.global.item = 0; $.global.total = slideCount; $('.slide').css('width', slideWindowWidth + 'px'); $('#slides-list').css('width', totalSlidesWidth + 'px'); $('#left').click(function () { resetAutoSlide(); performSlide('back'); }); $('#right').click(function () { resetAutoSlide(); performSlide('forward'); }); }); function performSlide(direction) { if (direction == 'back') { var nextSlideId = $.global.item - 1; } if (direction == 'forward') { var nextSlideId = $.global.item + 1; } if (nextSlideId == -1) { moveCss($.global.total - 1); } else if (nextSlideId == $.global.total) { moveCss(0); } else { moveCss(nextSlideId); } } function moveCss(nextSlideId) { var slideWindowWidth = $('#slide-window').width(); var margin = slideWindowWidth * nextSlideId; $('#slides-list').css('transform', 'translate3d(-' + margin + 'px,0px,0px)'); $.global.item = nextSlideId; } var autoSlide = parseInt(\"3000\", 10); var autoSlideInterval; function resetAutoSlide(){ if(autoSlide) { if(autoSlideInterval) { clearInterval(autoSlideInterval); } autoSlideInterval = setInterval(function(){ performSlide('forward'); }, autoSlide) } } resetAutoSlide(); });  ","date":1395241416,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1395241416,"objectID":"61799e6490c8e5b1adc72e75454c2611","permalink":"/project/geneva/","publishdate":"2014-03-19T17:03:36+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/geneva/","section":"project","summary":"Evaluating soft densification scenarios in Geneva","tags":["RD","research"],"title":"Urban densification and building performance","type":"project"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Peronato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1393632000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1393632000,"objectID":"645caee520820af1bd35e88c52af6add","permalink":"/publication/peronato-built-2014/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T20:32:54.748408Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peronato-built-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Augmenting built density helps achieve a sustainable urban development reducing, for example, transport-related energy consumption and greenfield urbanization. Yet, in order not to undermine solar potential and daylight, an integrated design approach guaranteeing building performance in dense urban contexts is needed. This thesis shows the application of building simulation tools into a parametric 3D modeling environment so as to calculate the potential energy production from solar systems, the energy needs for space heating/cooling and some climate-based daylight metrics for several design scenarios generated by the combination of fundamental geometrical parameters. This methodology is applied to three case-studies in Switzerland presenting different densification strategies at the neighborhood scale: the urban renewal of a brownfield site in Yverdon-les-Bains and two “soft densification” interventions in Geneva, i.e. roof raising in a central area and housing infill in a suburban residential district. Each case-study has been evaluated according to common morphological and environmental indicators, showing that the urban renewal project represents a good compromise between built density and building performance objectives. Moreover, a set of optimized design scenarios has been proposed for this strategy. Although the results of this work refer to specific case studies which are not representative of all urban contexts, at a methodological level the hereby presented procedure can be used as a decision support tool in the early urban design phase also in other situations and can facilitate the choice of the most appropriate densification strategy.","tags":null,"title":"Built density, solar potential and daylighting:  Application of parametric studies and performance simulation tools in urban design","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The theme of the studio was the design of high-density settlements in China using computational algorithms and parametric tools to generate shapes dynamically responding to external imputs (e.g. climate and topography) and custom parameters (e.g. number of inhabitants).\nThe project was based on the joint use of terraces and courtyards building typologies in order to design a city dealing with both the external landscape and a more intimate view inside the courtyard. The terraced structure aims at recreating the hill shape by using the contour lines as the main design input. A network of walkways is set up to connect the plain to the top of the hill, starting from points where there is a main variation of the curvature of the contour line. The hill is hence subdivided in different sectors, with different expositions to the sun and different slopes. Courtyards are designed to provide as much sunlight as possible to the dwellings. This is accomplished by introducing a “C” shaped typology, where the opening is always South-facing, as well as by increasing the height only of North-facing buildings. Furthermore, different courtyard shapes are defined according to their orientation. Outwards facing sides have different degrees of openness, ranging from completely closed (North-facing) to fully opened (South-facing). Finally, the roof is stretched according to the orientation in order to direct as much sunlight as possible into the courtyard.\nThe parametric workflow makes possible to transfer the design to other contexts as well as to easily increase the density while preserving all the design features.     \n","date":1355929416,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1355929416,"objectID":"1189ec4e564e26622eaca51f1f550fe5","permalink":"/project/citycarving/","publishdate":"2012-12-19T17:03:36+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/citycarving/","section":"project","summary":"A studio project on digital urban design","tags":["design","architecture"],"title":"City Carving","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Not used for 50 years and partially dismissed in 1968, the railway bridge crossing the Astico river (Vicenza’s area, north-east of Italy) is now a phantom infrastructure. The bridge starts from the east side of the valley and is truncated after three masonry arcades, because of the removal of the steel truss that used to connect it to the other side of the valley. Replaced by a new car bridge in the 70s, the sawn-off bridge is still a strong landmark that could be used to improve the touristic attractiveness of this area. The Astico valley is in fact an ideal place to practice water sports as well as hiking and cycling. The challenge of this project is the use of the bridge in a different way than its original function while recalling its past and preserving its iconic image of abandoned infra- structure.\nAn old train car recently dismissed from a railway in Sardinia that was also the last train model riding on this bridge was readapted as an information center welcoming the visitor. The passenger car reminds the old railway while symbolizing the possibility of recycling an old object into another function. The whole valley section was set up as a climbing practice wall with different difficulty degrees. The most trained climbers could reach the old railway tunnel, reused as a panoramic rest area. On the right side of the valley, a panoramic path leads to the valley bottom with equipped beaches and a natural swimming pool.\nThe architectural project fits in with the bridge as a parasite element, breaking the strict regularity of the historical artefact. The first arcade hosts some practice walls for children rock climbing, while the second one is crossed by the flying footbridge going to the 200 m2 bar-restaurant area located under the third arcade. The envelope of the restaurant is composed by the masonry pillars of the bridge on the South and North sides and by a new curtain wall on the East and West sides, designed so as to minimize the heat gains in summer.\n      ","date":1308495816,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1308495816,"objectID":"40dea279d5fc88d7829e09e8baec5058","permalink":"/project/ponte/","publishdate":"2011-06-19T17:03:36+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/ponte/","section":"project","summary":"A studio project on the reuse of an abandoned infrastructure","tags":["design","architecture"],"title":"Reuse-Recycle","type":"project"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Peronato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"2d3d3c8649dee1e645b10306333c09e9","permalink":"/publication/peronato-dimensione-2011/","publishdate":"2020-04-25T13:04:03.375145Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peronato-dimensione-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"A short academic essay on the use of oblique projections in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries","tags":null,"title":"La dimensione dell'ombra","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"A selection of linocut prints    \n","date":1271689416,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1271689416,"objectID":"79c6e3ab73daf7236e4943ac92f9c0b8","permalink":"/project/linocuts/","publishdate":"2010-04-19T17:03:36+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/linocuts/","section":"project","summary":"A selection of linocut prints","tags":["design","art"],"title":"Linocuts","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"A selection of oil and acrylic paintings     \n","date":1271689416,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1271689416,"objectID":"a3a0fe025c3602b64f85b6316ddf11a9","permalink":"/project/paintings/","publishdate":"2010-04-19T17:03:36+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/paintings/","section":"project","summary":"A selection of oil and acrylic paintings","tags":["design","art"],"title":"Paintings","type":"project"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Peronato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"3c7e4784722d9ee9aa81bbaa77a8ac5a","permalink":"/publication/peronato-arte-2008/","publishdate":"2020-04-25T13:04:03.374256Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peronato-arte-2008/","section":"publication","summary":"An essay on the concept of artistic copy and imitation during the classical era and the 21th century, with examples from Plato, Aristotle, Terence, Pseudo-Longinus, Benjamin, Pirandello, Warhol and others.","tags":null,"title":"L'arte della copia.
