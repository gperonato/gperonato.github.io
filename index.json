Buildings are in fact among the highest worldwide consumers of primary energy, mostly of fossil fuel origin, while still making insufficient use of in-situ renewable energy sources. To find a solution to this situation, many municipalities have promoted the use of solar cadastres mapping the solar energy potential of the existing building stock. However, their implementation has limits from different points of view including assessment accuracy, representation methods, and decision-support. To overcome these limits, this thesis proposes a planning-support system based on the photovoltaic (PV) potential of buildings. The goal is to provide decision-makers and stakeholders with a robust method to assess the potential of photovoltaic electricity generation of existing buildings under uncertain environmental conditions. The developed methodology is based on an urban-scale modeling workflow that includes the simulation of the photovoltaic electricity production and a simplified estimation of the building energy retrofit potential. Existing state-of-the-art models for solar radiation, building energy and PV performance are coupled in the workflow, which relies on a vector 3D city model featuring an accurate representation of buildings, terrain, and vegetation. The proposed modeling workflow also includes an innovative approach for simulating the arrangement of PV modules on the building envelope, which influences both the energy yield and the acceptability of the system. The modeling workflow is in turn integrated into a planning-support system that provides a robust assessment of the photovoltaic potential through risk-averse scenarios. We consider here two crucial yet underestimated uncertainty factors: weather and vegetation. The results are aggregated at different scales and, for each scale, the spatial locations are ranked through pairwise comparisons according to relevant energy indicators. The results are finally displayed in a 3D-mapping tool featuring false-color overlays at the considered aggregation scales to address different objectives and inform decision-makers. We conducted sensitivity analyses towards different input data resolutions and modeling scenarios so as to achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and computational cost and define confidence intervals for the calculated values. The simulated PV yield was also compared against measured data from an existing PV installation. The proposed modeling workflow and planning-support system were tested in an urban district within the city of Neuchâtel (Switzerland). The analysis highlighted areas with the highest potential and provided a priority list of interventions. It also showed the impact of vegetation on absolute results and especially on the ranking of the spatial locations evaluated by their energy potential.","tags":null,"title":"Urban planning support based on the photovoltaic potential of buildings: a multi-scenario ranking system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Peronato","Emmanuel Rey","Marilyne Andersen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543622400,"objectID":"0b3882fd43ee8f8e2e5947a8c5b15cc8","permalink":"/publication/peronato-3-d-2018/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T20:32:54.757971Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peronato-3-d-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The increasing interest in solar energy production in urban areas requires an accurate simulation of solar irradiation on building surfaces, including vertical surfaces. However, solar potential analyses are usually conducted on 2.5D models, which are limited to roof surfaces. Methods based on 3D models, instead, allow the simulation of solar radiation on all building surfaces also accounting for inter-reflections. 3D models are thus discretized by grids of sensor points on which the solar potential is calculated.  This paper investigates the discretization error in the assessment of solar potential based on 3D models. To this end, we tested the sensitivity of simulated solar irradiation to the resolution of the sensor grid. We analyzed the impact of the grid resolution using typical discretization approaches affecting the spatial arrangement of the sensor points.  The study was conducted in a dense area of the city of Geneva represented at level of detail (LOD) 2. The simulated solar irradiation on 109 buildings was analyzed at different spatial, i.e. per surface and per building, and temporal granularities, i.e. hourly and yearly.  The results show that the error increases linearly for grids spaced at up to 4 m with maximum relative root mean square error lower than 7%. The impact of the grid resolution was found greater for structured grids than unstructured grids. The results also highlight that finer grid resolutions (i.e. smaller spacing) are necessary if the analysis is conducted at high spatial or temporal granularity, notably when analyzing roof surfaces with shading artifacts.","tags":null,"title":"3D model discretization in assessing urban solar potential: the effect of grid spacing on predicted solar irradiation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Peronato","Parag Rastogi","Emmanuel Rey","Marilyne Andersen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"c168f5717a7dda17766c53a121c8d8e1","permalink":"/publication/peronato-toolkit-2018/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T20:32:54.763187Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peronato-toolkit-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Many municipalities and public authorities have supported the creation of solar cadastres to map the solar energy-generation potential of existing buildings.

To this end, this paper presents a novel method to incorporate uncertainty in the evaluation of the solar electricity generation potential of existing buildings using a multi-scale approach. It also presents a technique to visualise the results through their integration in a 3D-mapping environment and the use of false-colour overlays at different scales. Using multiple simulation scenarios, the method is able to provide information about confidence intervals of summary statistics of production due to variation in two typical uncertain factors: vegetation and weather. The uncertainty in production introduced by these factors is taken into account through pairwise comparisons of nominal values of indicators, calculating a comprehensive ranking of the energy potential of different spatial locations and a corresponding solar score. The analysis is run at different scales, using space- and time-aggregated results, to provide results relevant to decision-makers.","tags":["3D city model","Spatial decision-support systems","Urban solar potential"],"title":"A toolkit for multi-scale mapping of the solar energy-generation potential of buildings in urban environments under uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Peronato","Sergi Aguacil Moreno","Adrien Legrain","Sylvain Vitali","Emmanuel Rey","Marilyne Andersen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"08776cf53ecbedbaefbbf383aa686ceb","permalink":"/publication/peronato-assessing-2018/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T20:32:54.764465Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peronato-assessing-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"PV installations on flat roofs offer a wide range of design options, which are usually neglected in urban-scale assessments as these typically assume horizontal or other fixed arrangements.

Their application to the urban scale is hence difficult. As an alternative to the existing approaches, we developed an interface to CitySim, a validated building simulation tool adapted to urban scale assessments, bundled as a plug-in for Grasshopper, a popular parametric design platform. On the one hand, CitySim allows faster simulations and requires fewer parameters than traditional BPS tools, as it is based on algorithms providing a good trade-off between the simulations requirements and their accuracy at the urban scale; on the other hand, Grasshopper allows the easy manipulation of building masses and energy simulation parameters through semi-automated parametric workflows. In this paper, we present a preliminary version of the developed plug-in and a typical design workflow for the simulation and visualization of building performance at the neighbourhood scale.

Pourtant, le potentiel solaire n’a pas une définition univoque. Comme nous l’avons déjà vu dans les précédents ouvrages de cette série, il est possible d’opérer une première distinction entre potentiel solaire actif et passif. Le premier se décline en potentiel solaire actif pour systèmes thermiques (production d’eau chaude) et pour systèmes photovoltaïques (production d’électricité). Dans le deuxième, on peut distinguer le potentiel solaire passif pour le chauffage de l’espace intérieur à travers les gains solaires, et l’éclairage à travers la lumière naturelle. Dans la présente étude, nous allons examiner l’irradiation annuelle sur les surfaces des bâtiments, que l’on peut considérer comme un premier indicateur du potentiel solaire actif, sans compter les pertes dues à la transformation en chaleur ou en électricité. Une évaluation du potentiel solaire dès les premières phases du projet, c’est-à-dire lorsque l’on aborde la question de la forme urbaine, permet une intégration plus efficace des critères de performance énergétique. En effet, très souvent, ces questions ne sont abordées que dans les phases avancées du projet, lorsqu’il est plus difficile d’effectuer des changements significatifs sur le projet. Cette étude s’inscrit donc dans une démarche d’évaluation précoce du potentiel solaire de différentes formes urbaines. Les visions urbaines développées par les étudiants de l’atelier du Prof. Emmanuel Rey pour le site de Crissier et présentées dans cet ouvrage se prêtent particulièrement bien à cet exercice d’analyse comparative, car elles présentent des formes urbaines très différenciées.

Due to the complex shape and seasonal variability of vegetation geometry, this topic has gained much attention from researchers. However, existing methods are limited to rooftops as they are based on 2.5D geometry and use simplified radiation algorithms based on view-sheds. This work contributes to overcoming some of these limitations, providing support for 3D geometry to include facades. Thanks to the use of ray-tracing-based simulations and detailed characterization of the 3D surfaces, we can also account for inter-reflections, which might have a significant impact on façade irradiation. In order to construct confidence intervals on our results, we modeled vegetation from LiDAR point clouds as 3D convex hulls, which provide the biggest volume and hence the most conservative obstruction scenario. The limits of the confidence intervals were characterized with some extreme scenarios (e.g. opaque trees and absence of trees). Results show that uncertainty can vary significantly depending on the characteristics of the urban area and the granularity of the analysis (sensor, building and group of buildings). We argue that this method can give us a better understanding of the uncertainties due to vegetation in the assessment of solar irradiation in urban environments, and therefore, the potential for the installation of solar energy systems.","tags":null,"title":"3D-modeling of vegetation from LiDAR point clouds and assessment of its impact on façade solar irradiation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Peronato","Stéphane Bonjour","Jérémie Stoeckli","Emmanuel Rey","Marilyne Andersen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1467331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467331200,"objectID":"a3151fb0c0ed924136edcd9c13bd9453","permalink":"/publication/peronato-sensitivity-2016/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T20:32:54.75496Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peronato-sensitivity-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The assessment of the solar potential in urban areas relies on a geometrical model that can be defined at different levels of detail (LOD).

Since these are typically fixed at the early-design phase, performance assessment methods based on solar considerations at the urban scale are essential to support early decision-making. As the adaptation of the well-developed building performance simulation methods to the urban scale lead to complexity issues, it is of interest to verify whether simpler metrics can act as performance indicators, as is often done at the building level with quantities such as form factor.  This paper first presents a review of existing methods that aim at evaluating aspects such as passive heating and photovoltaic potential. We classify each evaluation metric based on its level of complexity, before choosing a representative subset to be further examined. The goal is to test whether simple metrics fulfill their role as performance indicators when applied to neighborhoods. To do so, the selected metrics, including geometrical parameters (e.g. compactness) and solar exposure levels (e.g. annual irradiation), are compared with simulation results (e.g. heating need), taken as reference values.

Results, which show various levels of correlation between simple metrics and the reference values, highlight the limitations of using any one metric and indicate a need to revise the definition and evaluation metrics of various performance criteria for neighborhood designs.","tags":["Correlation","Early-design phase","Neighborhood scale","Passive/active solar potential","Performance metrics","Simulation"],"title":"Review and critical analysis of early-design phase evaluation metrics for the solar potential of neighborhood designs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Peronato","Emilie Nault","Francesca Cappelletti","Fabio Peron","Marilyne Andersen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"babc081ad1e3d514a0ef5bc218041032","permalink":"/publication/peronato-parametric-2015/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T20:32:54.750793Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peronato-parametric-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper focuses on parametric design-based visualization methods to represent building performance at the neighborhood scale in the perspective of an integrated design-support system.

Une exploitation ciblée des ressources sous forme passive permettra donc de minimiser la demande des systèmes consommateurs d’énergie (p. ex. chauffage, climatisation), alors qu’une exploitation active du rayonnement à l’aide de systèmes solaires actifs permettra d’augmenter l’autonomie énergétique des bâtiments. Le présent chapitre porte sur l’évaluation de la performance énergétique de chacun des huit projets élaborés pour le secteur Gare-Lac du point de vue de leur potentiel solaire passif et actif. La première section traite des critères passifs, pour lesquels des indicateurs de performance sont introduits et calculés à l’aide de simulations détaillées exécutées sur les modèles 3D des projets. La section suivante présente l’analyse de la production d’énergie à travers une évaluation simplifiée du potentiel solaire actif selon des critères d’autonomie énergétique et de rentabilité économique. En conclusion, une comparaison des résultats confronte les projets et les indicateurs de performance utilisés Cette étude s’inscrit dans le cadre des projets doctoraux d’Emilie Nault et de Giuseppe Peronato, réalisés sous la direction conjointe des Professeurs Marilyne Andersen du Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire de Performance Intégrée au Projet (LIPID) et Emmanuel Rey du Laboratoire d’Architecture et de Technologies Durables (LAST).","tags":null,"title":"Potentiel solaire et forme urbaine","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe Peronato","Emmanuel Rey","Marilyne Andersen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"a161c29401035cf60a257aad593f4d9d","permalink":"/publication/peronato-sampling-2015/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T20:32:54.751789Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peronato-sampling-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Although the integration of PV systems in the building envelope (BIPV) is an important factor for the acceptability of such installations, current urban-scale solar potential metrics only partially consider this aspect. As part of the definition of BIPV-suitable surfaces, we argue that a geometric-regularity criterion can help predict the possible disposition of solar panels already in the early assessment of BIPV potential in urban contexts. To address this need, we developed an algorithm for the geometric sampling of the parts of the building envelope achieving a minimum irradiation threshold, with the aim of defining uniformly-covered active solar surfaces. The proposed methodology is implemented in a flexible parametric design platform and tested in a case study in Neuchâtel (Switzerland). We show that integrating geometric regularity in the assessment of BIPV potential can have a significant influence in the calculation of the solar energy production and discuss the value of such information in urban planning practices.","tags":null,"title":"Sampling of building surfaces towards an early assessment of BIPV potential in urban contexts","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"This project investigated the impact of early-design urban massing on built density and building performance indicators.

Yet, in order not to undermine solar potential and daylight, an integrated design approach guaranteeing building performance in dense urban contexts is needed. This thesis shows the application of building simulation tools into a parametric 3D modeling environment so as to calculate the potential energy production from solar systems, the energy needs for space heating/cooling and some climate-based daylight metrics for several design scenarios generated by the combination of fundamental geometrical parameters. This methodology is applied to three case-studies in Switzerland presenting different densification strategies at the neighborhood scale: the urban renewal of a brownfield site in Yverdon-les-Bains and two “soft densification” interventions in Geneva, i.e. roof raising in a central area and housing infill in a suburban residential district. Each case-study has been evaluated according to common morphological and environmental indicators, showing that the urban renewal project represents a good compromise between built density and building performance objectives. Moreover, a set of optimized design scenarios has been proposed for this strategy. Although the results of this work refer to specific case studies which are not representative of all urban contexts, at a methodological level the hereby presented procedure can be used as a decision support tool in the early urban design phase also in other situations and can facilitate the choice of the most appropriate densification strategy.","tags":null,"title":"Built density, solar potential and daylighting:  Application of parametric studies and performance simulation tools in urban design","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The theme of the studio was the design of high-density settlements in China using computational algorithms and parametric tools to generate shapes dynamically responding to external imputs (e.g. climate and topography) and custom parameters (e.g. number of inhabitants).\nThe project was based on the joint use of terraces and courtyards building typologies in order to design a city dealing with both the external landscape and a more intimate view inside the courtyard. The terraced structure aims at recreating the hill shape by using the contour lines as the main design input. A network of walkways is set up to connect the plain to the top of the hill, starting from points where there is a main variation of the curvature of the contour line. The hill is hence subdivided in different sectors, with different expositions to the sun and different slopes. Courtyards are designed to provide as much sunlight as possible to the dwellings. This is accomplished by introducing a “C” shaped typology, where the opening is always South-facing, as well as by increasing the height only of North-facing buildings. Furthermore, different courtyard shapes are defined according to their orientation. Outwards facing sides have different degrees of openness, ranging from completely closed (North-facing) to fully opened (South-facing). Finally, the roof is stretched according to the orientation in order to direct as much sunlight as possible into the courtyard.\nThe parametric workflow makes possible to transfer the design to other contexts as well as to easily increase the density while preserving all the design features.     \n","date":1355929416,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1355929416,"objectID":"1189ec4e564e26622eaca51f1f550fe5","permalink":"/project/citycarving/","publishdate":"2012-12-19T17:03:36+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/citycarving/","section":"project","summary":"A studio project on digital urban design","tags":["design","architecture"],"title":"City Carving","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Not used for 50 years and partially dismissed in 1968, the railway bridge crossing the Astico river (Vicenza’s area, north-east of Italy) is now a phantom infrastructure. The bridge starts from the east side of the valley and is truncated after three masonry arcades, because of the removal of the steel truss that used to connect it to the other side of the valley. Replaced by a new car bridge in the 70s, the sawn-off bridge is still a strong landmark that could be used to improve the touristic attractiveness of this area. The Astico valley is in fact an ideal place to practice water sports as well as hiking and cycling. The challenge of this project is the use of the bridge in a different way than its original function while recalling its past and preserving its iconic image of abandoned infra- structure.\nAn old train car recently dismissed from a railway in Sardinia that was also the last train model riding on this bridge was readapted as an information center welcoming the visitor. The passenger car reminds the old railway while symbolizing the possibility of recycling an old object into another function. The whole valley section was set up as a climbing practice wall with different difficulty degrees. The most trained climbers could reach the old railway tunnel, reused as a panoramic rest area. On the right side of the valley, a panoramic path leads to the valley bottom with equipped beaches and a natural swimming pool.\nThe architectural project fits in with the bridge as a parasite element, breaking the strict regularity of the historical artefact. The first arcade hosts some practice walls for children rock climbing, while the second one is crossed by the flying footbridge going to the 200 m2 bar-restaurant area located under the third arcade. The envelope of the restaurant is composed by the masonry pillars of the bridge on the South and North sides and by a new curtain wall on the East and West sides, designed so as to minimize the heat gains in summer.\n      ","date":1308495816,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1308495816,"objectID":"40dea279d5fc88d7829e09e8baec5058","permalink":"/project/ponte/","publishdate":"2011-06-19T17:03:36+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/ponte/","section":"project","summary":"A studio project on the reuse of abandoned infrastructure","tags":["design","architecture"],"title":"Reuse-Recycle","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"A selection of oil and acrylic paintings     \n","date":1271689416,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1271689416,"objectID":"a3a0fe025c3602b64f85b6316ddf11a9","permalink":"/project/paintings/","publishdate":"2010-04-19T17:03:36+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/paintings/","section":"project","summary":"A selection of oil and acrylic paintings","tags":["design","art"],"title":"Paintings","type":"project"}]
