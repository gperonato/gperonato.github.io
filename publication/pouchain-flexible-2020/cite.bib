	abstract = {The design of district heating and cooling ({DHC}) networks is crucial to increase the pooling of energy supply and demand between individual buildings, and thus to reduce the environmental and financial costs of the energy systems. {DHC} networks are also useful to increase the share of renewable energy sources in cities, their integration being more challenging in high-density environments. This paper presents a novel simulation framework for the optimization of building energy systems connected to a district heating and cooling network. The developed method is based on the open-source Python library {PyPSA} and is adapted for the early-design exploration of multiple scenarios and their optimization, based on {GIS} input data. We show the application of the proposed method into a fictitious district in France composed of mixed-use buildings. The results compare two scenarios of energy systems minimizing either greenhouse gas emissions or the energy cost.},
