       abstract = {We present a workflow for the development and deployment of a data-driven model to estimate the hourly heating demand of buildings.The model is trained and tested using CityGML with the Energy ADE specification and Meteonorm CLI weather-files as the source of the input features.Through an optimization pipeline, an ensemble model including a gradient boosting algorithm presenting a RMSE of 9.5 Wh/m2 of floor area (98.7\% accuracy) and low memory requirements is selected. A short-term predicting model is also developed reporting a RMSE of 4.2 Wh/m2 of floor area (99.7\% accuracy).A web service providing access to a REST API deploying the data-driven model is also developed, allowing for a wide range of applications in third-party tools such as in GIS analysis.}
